Hope you're ready for another cracking day of tennis. First up we turn our sights to Kooyong in Melbourne, Australia for the reverse singles rubbers. Here&rsquo;s the order of play&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Bernard Tomic (AUS) v John Isner (USA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Followed by&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Sam Groth (AUS) v Jack Sock (USA)</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="3" gmt="00:08" icon="iquote" tle="From DavisCup.com’s Suzi Petkovski..."><![CDATA[<p>Today's reverse singles at Kooyong are a couple of minutes away and intrigue regarding the Aussie line-up continues. For the hosts, all rests on the shoulders of Bernard Tomic. If the No.1 Aussie can again overcome an opponent he has never before beaten in John Isner, and extend the tie to a fifth rubber, there's a more than even chance Lleyton Hewitt will take the court for the decider, in place of the out-of-form Sam Groth. The Aussie captain has a win over Jack Sock on grass and beat the American No.2 at the Hopman Cup just weeks ago, when they shared a sporting moment. Not least, it was Hewitt who clinched the tie for Australia against Kazakhstan last July in Darwin, on home turf.</p>

Wrap your head around this stat: Mayer dropped just TWO points on serve in that opener and he lost the set! The turning point came when Przysiezny hustled back a Mayer overhead at 4-4 in the shootout only for the Argentine to fluff a low backhand volley. That gave Przysiezny a 5-4 advantage and he nervelessly served out the next two points. It&rsquo;ll be VERY interesting to see how Mayer reacts to the disappointment.

This time last year remember, Leo Mayer won the second longest match of all time - and the longest Davis Cup singles match - when he beat Brazilian Joao Souza 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5), 5-7, 5-7, 15-13. That one lasted six hours and 42 minutes. I'm going to start carbo-loading on Polish deserts just to be on the safe side&hellip;"</p>]]></blog>

A tough job for the German who is trying to level the tie for the home side against the 2012 and 2013 Czech champions.&nbsp;</p>]]></blog>
    <blog id="61" gmt="12:31" icon="iwint" bg="bgGrn" tle="Thailand 3-2 Sri Lanka"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick peek over the fence in Bangkok, where Thailand have tied up victory against Sri Lanka in Asia/Oceania World Group II. It went down to the fifth rubber where Pruchya Isarow came through 64 67(5) 63 76(6) against Harshanna Godamanna to book the Thais' place in July's second round. Congratulations!</p>]]></blog>
    <blog id="62" gmt="12:35" icon="iinjury" tle="Tomas takes a time out"><![CDATA[<p>Concern for the Czech team. Tomas Berdych has just the left court in Hannover for a medical timeout. The world No.7 was indicating he might have a problem with his left upper thigh. He's just been broken by Philipp Kohlschreiber too in the opening set.</p>]]></blog>
    <blog id="63" gmt="12:37" tle="DavisCup.com's Leigh Walsh in Hannover" ed="1" edt="12:37" icon="gercze"><![CDATA[<p>An interesting start here in the TUI Arena as Kohlschreiber secures the first break of the match to go 3-2 up. The German is looking much sharper than he did in Friday's scratchy win over Lukas Rosol. I'll be honest, I didn't see that break coming. Kohlschreiber spent the first two games on Berdych's serve looping returns down the centre of the court, right into the Czech's hitting zone, but in that game he stepped up. A roaring forehand return winner at deuce gave him a second break point and he duly converted.</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="66" gmt="12:46" tle="DavisCup.com's Lee Goodall in Gdansk"><![CDATA[<p>Mayer edges another serve-dominated set - no man has had a single break point from 24 service games so far. Przysiezny dug himself a hole when he missed a backhand volley on the opening point of the breaker to give Mayer an immediate advantage and back-to-back aces made it 3-0. Try as he might, Przysiezny couldn't get back on level terms and Mayer closed it out 7-4 with an ace up the &lsquo;T&rsquo;. Game on.</p>]]></blog>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big match here this afternoon between two stars of the sport, Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori. It&rsquo;s actually the first time, though, that Murray has faced a top-10 player in Davis Cup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murray has never lost a Davis Cup singles rubber on a hard court, he is currently 12-0. Nishikori is currently on an 11-match Davis Cup singles winning streak. Something has to give.</p>

And it's gone the way of Leo Mayer, who is finding his groove now for Argentina. If Mayer wins this match against Michal Przysiezny then Argentina will go through to meet Italy in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup by BNP Paribas.&nbsp;</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="73" gmt="13:09" icon="srbkaz" tle="Djokovic 6-5 *Kukushkin "><![CDATA[<p>A big service hold from Novak Djokovic in Belgrade. He fights off a break point chance with a powerful drive-volley which Mikhail Kukushkin flies into the net. Djokovic roars as he moves to within one game of the opening set. It's really been tantalising tennis. Have we said that already?</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="76" gmt="13:15" icon="iinfo" tle="Murray has edge on Nishikori"><![CDATA[<p>Murray-Nishikori is arguably the most high profile individual clash this weekend, bringing together as it does two players ranked inside the top six in the world. Murray holds a 5-1 record over his Japanese adversary, the Scotsman's only defeat coming at the ATP World Tour Finals in 2014. Intriguingly, all six of those clashes have been won in straight sets.</p>]]></blog>
    <blog id="77" gmt="13:19" icon="belcro" tle="Goffin 1-1 *Cilic"><![CDATA[<p>From our reporter <strong>Clive White:</strong> Weary or not, David Goffin has begun the onerous task of keeping last year's runners-up in contention in this Davis Cup World Group first round tie in Liege against Croatia's Marin Cilic, who unlike the Belgian was able to put his feet up on Saturday. An encouraging start from the Belgian No 1 as he breaks the world No 12 in the opening game with a forehand winner. Somewhat surprisingly, these two have never met before.</p>
<p><br /><em>Update: Cilic has immediately broken back...</em></p>]]></blog>
    <blog id="78" gmt="13:20" tle="DavisCup.com's Lee Goodall in Gdansk" iid="225520"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In hindsight, maybe that missed Michal Przysiezny backhand volley at the start of the second set breaker turned the match? The margins are that fine at this level. The first break of the day finally went to Leo Mayer in the second game of the third set. The Argentine converted his third break point with a ripper of a cross-court forehand to go up 2-0. Mayer maintained that advantage - he's still only dropped a measly seven points on serve in three sets - and Przysiezny buckled again when serving to stay in the set at 2-5, Mayer&rsquo;s second break of the match coming courtesy of a double fault on set point. Argentina now a set away from a quarterfinal trip to Italy...</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="81" gmt="13:29" icon="srbkaz" tle="Djokovic 67 0-0 *Kukushkin"><![CDATA[<p>Well, well, well what a fascinating opening set we've just witnessed in Belgrade. After six service holds apiece, Mikhail Kukushkin muscles his way through the tiebreak 86. On the other side of the net, Novak Djokovic flares his eyes and then troops back to his seat.

To the delight of the home crowd it's gone to their man. Murray returns well to bring up 15-40 on the Nishikori serve.

Mikhail Kukushkin produced a flawless performance to win an absorbing first set against home crowd favourite Novak Djokovic 76 and bring Kazakhstan, who are 2-1 ahead in the tie, a step closer to stunning the 2010 Davis Cup winners. A jam-packed arena is also producing an exhilarating contest between rivals fans, both charged with drums and trumpets.

<p><br />Goffin has definitely settled the better in Liege and is tending to win the more extended rallies. Too many mistakes in Cilic's game at the moment. The Belgian is still one break up at 43.</p>]]></blog>

The Hannover home fans are on their feet, tooting horns and clapping as they urge on their man, who must win this match to level the tie for Germany. Berdych, who beat Kolschreiber in the doubles yesterday, is looking a bit tired but he is also keen on adding to his 50 Davis Cup wins.&nbsp;</p>]]></blog>

It's all thanks to <strong>Leonardo Mayer</strong> who turned up the heat to come through a 67(4) 76 (4)62 63 winner against Michal Przysiezny.

The world No.7 had a medical timeout after being broken in the opening set, which he lost 63, for a thigh injury and he did look like he was struggling.

We are level at 2-2 here in Hannover as Tomas Berdych pulls the plug after dropping the second set to Philipp Kohlschreiber. Berdych went off court after the fifth game of the first set for some treatment on his leg and he returned with his right thigh heavily strapped. He clearly couldn't carry on anymore, but credit must go to the German who played extremely well today. Now for a decisive fifth rubber, which will see Sascha Zverev take on Lukas Rosol. Both captains do have the option to change their nominations - could we see Radek Stepanek summoned? Let's see...&nbsp;</p>]]></blog>
    <blog id="94" gmt="14:05" icon="belcro" tle="Goffin* 64 2-1 Cilic" ed="1" edt="14:07"><![CDATA[<p>There's another break for Goffin at the top of the second set, Cilic still struggling to land his first serve and still struggling to back up his second serves with decent tennis - far too many unforced errors from the big Croat's racket so far.</p>
<p><br />Here's <strong>Clive White</strong>: "Rather than looking worn out on a third&nbsp;consecutive day on court, Goffin looks more in the groove than Cilic. The big difference is second serve - Cilic's is being dealt with severely. He has won only 33% of second serve points compared to the Belgian's 68%."</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="97" gmt="14:17" icon="gbrjpn" tle="Murray* 75 0-0 Nishikori"><![CDATA[<p>Two double-faults from Nishikori in game 12 cost him dearly, bringing Murray two break points. Much to the British star's fury, he tosses away the first one but is not so profligate with the next, keeping the ball in play in a long rally and pulling his opponent across the court before Nishikori nets. One hour on the clock, one set on the board for GB.</p>]]></blog>

    <blog id="100" gmt="14:28" icon="gbrjpn" tle="Murray* 75 0-2 Nishikori"><![CDATA[<p>Nishikori breaks Murray at the start of the second set and backs it up with a hold having been taken to 30-30. The last two points in particular showed Nishikori at his best - dashing about the court with nimble footwork and putting Murray under pressure to come up with a winner.</p>]]></blog>

<p>Murray is being extended quite regularly by Nishikori and getting fairly agitated at times, with Leon Smith&nbsp;standing up on several occasions to try to&nbsp;impart some wisdom through telepathy. As for Dan Evans and Jamie Murray, they appear to be putting faith in divine providence.</p>]]></blog>

<p>Is it&nbsp;looking ominous for Germany's Davis Cup debutant Alexander Zverev? After a bright start, the 18-year-old pumps the ball long to hand two set points to Lukas Rosol. The first one sails past but Zverev nets to hands the Czechs the crucial first set.&nbsp;</p>]]></blog>

The treatment helped for a while, but basically that was it. I knew it wasn't getting better and I couldn't play on the level that I wanted to. There was no chance I could finish the match."</p>]]></blog>

Why so cheery? Because only an Argentina win could have guaranteed the Italians another home tie on clay. Having been unbeaten on Italian soil for seven years in Davis Cup ties, Barazzutti insists: "Playing at home is key."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He believes it could pave the way towards their first title since he played in their sole 1976 triumph. "We always must have dreams," Barazzutti told me with a smile last night. He's smiling even more now that Italy have gone 4-0 up with his debutant<strong> Marco Cecchinato</strong> beating Adrien Bossel 63 75. &nbsp;</p>]]></blog>

Certainly Goffin contributed greatly to losing the third set 63 with three double faults in the sixth game, the only game in which he has been broken since the start of the match. Clearly, Cilic's confidence is now up and Goffin's a little down. It's going to be fascinating here on in.</p>]]></blog>

<p>Murray leads 4-0 in the tiebreak, but thumps a forehand into the net. Two serves for Nishikori now, what can he do? He wins them both, Murray failing to land either of his returns in bounds. Nishikori wins the next rally to make it 4-4, before the next two points are shared. Set point for Nishikori now as Murray floats one long. But back comes the dual Grand Slam champion, winning both his serves to go from 5-6 down to 7-6 ahead and when Nishikori tamely nets a groundstroke - in the middle of which Murray had produced an outstanding retrieve - the second set is finally in the bag for Great Britain.</p>]]></blog>

<p><br />Looked like Andy Murray was about to throw the tiebreak away from a 4-0 lead but he saves a set point and then produces some terrific defence to take a two-set lead and put Great Britain just one set from the quarterfinals.</p>
<p><br />Towards the end of the set, Murray noticeably had a glance up towards the big screen which was showing the scores from the other ties, no doubt paying particular interest in Serbia vs Kazakhstan. If Britain go through, they face a home tie against the Kazakhs or an away trip to Serbia.</p>]]></blog>

The 18-year-old trails Rosol by two sets to love and is struggling to find any sort of rhythm against the Czech No. 2, who likes to give the ball a good whack. The Czechs are one-set from a spot in the quarterfinals, but in a tie full of twists and turns we can't rule out the Germans just yet.&nbsp;</p>]]></blog>

<p>Mikhail Kukushkin noses ahead again after winning the third set against Novak Djokovic, meaning that Kazakhstan are one set away from pulling off what would be a stunning upset in Belgrade. The players traded a flurry of breaks throughout the third set before Kukushkin held serve to close it out with a pair of sublime volleys. Looking tired and bereft of ideas, Djokovic will have to find the energy he is lacking at the moment if he is to keep Serbia's challenge alive.</p>

Three more break points come Goffin's way. He spurns the first two, but not the third. And the crowds really come to life when Cilic's slightly cramped backhand sails half a metre long.</p>]]></blog>

The 18-year-old is highly rated as a rising star on the ATP Tour but the Davis Cup brings unique pressures. Rosol, the world No.50, may only have played 12 ties but the Czech team have bags of experience and desire. A couple of slapdash shots from Zverev see him broken again. The Czechs will surely be packing their bags for a home tie with France now.</p>]]></blog>

<p>"For sure, there's a chance that the two of them will be back in September," shrugged Fed's old pal Luthi, who was grateful to have them both back for last year's equivalent tie which saw the Swiss beat the Netherlands in just two days.
